/* 
probably going to need a screen of pieces you can choose from for the ol switcharoo,
or just a pop-up of the pieces.- does it count as a turn (do you have to wait)

when you get to point a from point b, pop up on which side of the screen for which player
or does it appear on the same side of the screen for each. do we put the taken pieces on
the side of the person who took them or on the side of the person who lost them?

if we're making the board smaller to compensate for the sidelines, then what are our
exact coordinates for each square and piece. What are our transitions of the movements
for each piece going to look like? Does the piece slide or does it just appear where you 
click?
